# Task Management
---
## Introduction
Our team uses asana as our project / task management tool. We use this to keep track of the main activities we are performing on projects, and to stay on top of everything we are doing. The purpose of this document is to help familiarise yourself with the process of how to create tasks, assign to people, and set deadlines.

## How we operate
We typically work in two week sprint intervals -- this means when creating tasks, we need to create them to be fairly small and manageable. Ideally, no task should span more than two weeks. If they do, they should be split up into several smaller tasks.

We will typically work with a client to commit to tasks that need to be performed, and a timeline for that task. We divide tasks into two different buckets of tasks - committed, and non-committed. Committed tasks simply mean that we have promised to perform the task for a client and we are responsible for delivering this task. Non-committed tasks on the other hand are tasks that are still in discussion, have not been assigned, nor have a deadline. This essentially acts as a backlog.

## How to name a task
Task naming is possibly one of the hardest things to do -- to keep things simple, tasks should:

+ Have an identifier -- if there are multiple assets on a project, something to identify the asset
+ Have a reference -- what the task is referring to
+ Have a verb -- some action needs to be implied


For example, a task to fix an issue on a project called Handshake would read as:

**Handshake - Homepage - Design** 

Where *Handshake* is the identifier, *IE* is the reference as to what needs to be looked at, and *Fix Bugs* is the action that needs to be taken.
