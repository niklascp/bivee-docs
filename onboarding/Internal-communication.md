## Communication

Most of the time there are many things happening at the same time and it can be difficult and overwhelming to keep track what is going on and where. Here are some apps that help us stay connected and up to date. 

* Slack

Slack is where our everyday communication happens. It is the best way to reach someone or everyone at once. There we share things that don't necessarily need to be saved.

** Great for: receiving quick feedback, asking or answering brief questions, random thoughts, sharing meeting agendas, code troubleshooting, pictures of dogs with funny haircuts.

_To access_: 

	- Download the Slack app from App Store,
	- connect to Bivee channel through login credentials/invite from person
	- Ask anyone from the team to add you to the respected channels 
	
* Zoom

Zoom is our virtual meeting room. There we discussing more complex things, such as how to use a tool or questions on a project approach. 

	- Great for: meetings, remote coworking, pair programming

If you are scheduling a meeting to take place at our Zoom Bivee Room (talk.bivee.co), send a calendar invite to admin@bivee.co to reserve it. This would prevent other people from highjacking your meeting. 

_To access_: Download the Zoom app to your computer. When joining a meeting, visit http://talk.bivee.co to connect.

* Gmail

We don't use email to communicate between each other. Anything you write in an email should ideally be recorded in one of the other channels, so it doesn't get lost in the email archive abyss. 

	 - Great for: talking to clients, keeping track of deliverables and project assets
