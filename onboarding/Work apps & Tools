#Work apps & Tool    s 

As a company of mainly remote workers, we use a variety of communication tools & platforms to manage our workflow, stay in touch, and provide support. Our tools basically work on a scale from "most immediate" to "most permanent." The "most immediate" tools are the quickest but also the most temporary in terms of saving content. The "most permanent" tools require more setup (ie, provision a repository or format a document) but they can be saved forever and easily referenced later. Here's the major ones with their best uses

##Knowledge Management

*Naming Conventions
We are all used to working in our own little bubble â€“ some of us are complete OCD freaks, and others enjoy working in absolute chaos, but that seems to make sense to you. For all of our sanity, [here][1] is how we like to structure our files, folders and the like to keep things sorted.

*Google Drive
Used for collaborative work on long-form/more complex stuff that we need to store (semi) permanently, as well as a storage for all work related files (word, excel, pdf). Files can easily be referenced/shared on any other channel (e.g., through a link shared on Slack). Sharing settings can be adjusted to allow for partner firm or client collaboration on a document when needed. 
In Drive you can find: `All files related to Proposal Development - TOR, RFP, Case studies, Resumes, Gantt charts, Meeting notes, as well as final(pdf) versions of EOI and Submitted Proposals
